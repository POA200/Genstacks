## üöÄ Overview

**GENSTACKS** is a decentralized application (dApp) designed to provide creators with a powerful, interactive tool to generate unique, rarity-controlled NFT collections. Built on the **Stacks Blockchain**, GENSTACKS currently functions as a robust collection generator, preparing all necessary image assets and decentralized metadata for subsequent on-chain minting.

The current version (V1) focuses on generating assets and collecting a service fee for download, with future plans (V2) for full, integrated on-chain minting.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Stacks Wallet Integration:** Connects seamlessly with **Leather** and **Xverse** wallets.
- **Layered Trait Management:** Simple UI for uploading image layers (traits) and defining their stacking order.
- **Advanced Rarity Control:** Intuitive controls to set rarity percentages for individual traits, ensuring statistical fairness.
- **CSPRNG Generation:** Uses a Cryptographically Secure Pseudo-Random Number Generator (CSPRNG) on the backend for verifiable randomness.
- **Decentralized Asset Preparation:** Automatically uploads and pins final generated NFT images and metadata (with IPFS CIDs) to **IPFS/Arweave**.
- **V1 Service Fee:** Utilizes a custom Clarity contract (`nft-fee-collector.clar`) to process a **50 STX** service fee for asset download.

| **Frontend**       | `React`, `TypeScript`, `TailwindCSS` | User interface and wallet interaction using `Stacks.js`.                              |
| **Backend**        | `Node.js`, `Express`, `PostgreSQL`   | Handles trait storage, NFT generation logic, and API routes.                          |
| **Storage**        | `IPFS` / `Arweave`                   | Permanent, decentralized storage for final NFT image assets and metadata.             |
| **Blockchain**     | `Stacks`                             | The layer for transaction processing (V1 fee collection) and future NFT minting (V2). |
| **Smart Contract** | `Clarity`                            | Logic for V1 fee collection and future V2 NFT standards/minting.                      |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version)
- npm or yarn
- A Stacks Wallet (e.g., Xverse) for testing blockchain interactions.
- A running PostgreSQL instance.
- IPFS/Arweave API access (e.g., Pinata, Web3.Storage) credentials.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/POA200/Genstacks.git
    cd Genstacks
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    # Install server dependencies
    cd server
    npm install

    # Install client dependencies
    cd ../client
    npm install
    cd ..
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and populate it based on `.env.example`. This will include:

    - Database connection strings (`DATABASE_URL`)
    - IPFS/Arweave API keys (`IPFS_API_KEY`, etc.)
    - Clarity Contract ID for V1 (`V1_FEE_CONTRACT_ID`)
    - Wallet address for receiving the fee (`FEE_RECIPIENT_ADDRESS`)

### Running Locally

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**

    ```bash
    cd server
    npm start # Or 'npm run dev'
    # Server should run on http://localhost:3000
    ```

2.  **Start the Frontend App:**

    ```bash
    cd ../client
    npm start
    # Client should open on http://localhost:5173 (or similar)
    ```

## üìú Clarity Contracts

This dApp utilizes two distinct Clarity contracts to manage its current and future state:

| Contract                        | Version          | Purpose                                                                                                                    |
| :------------------------------ | :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `nft-fee-collector.clar`        | **V1 (Current)** | Handles the 50 STX service fee payment for asset download. The backend monitors logs from this contract to verify payment. |
| `genstacks-nft-collection.clar` | **V2 (Future)**  | Defines the Non-Fungible Token and integrates the fee into a single `mint` transaction.                                    |

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap (V2 & Beyond)

The core focus of V1 is stability and verifiable generation. Our future plans include:

- **V2 - Full On-Chain Minting:** Implementing the `genstacks-nft-collection.clar` contract to allow users to mint their collections directly onto the Stacks Blockchain post-generation.
- **Marketplace Integration:** Allowing creators to list their newly minted NFTs directly on Stacks marketplaces.
- **Advanced Multimedia:** Support for generating collections with video/audio traits.
